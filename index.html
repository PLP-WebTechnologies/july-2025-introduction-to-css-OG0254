        <h2>Why Cybersecurity Matters</h2>
        <p>
            In our hyper-connected world, personal data, finances, and even our identities are under constant threat from cybercriminals. 
            Cybersecurity is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, and networks from malicious attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Threats such as phishing scams, ransomware, and identity theft are more common than ever. 
            Knowing how to spot these dangers and prevent them is the first step toward keeping yourself safe online.
